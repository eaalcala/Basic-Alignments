# Basic Alignments

## Overview

This directory serves as a project for UBIC's Workshop Series, SP24. We focus on dynamic programming and alignment techniques.

## Project Details

In the first part, we look into Smith-Waterman Algorithm for alignment and implement it using LL structure focusing on OOP and DP ideas
Next, we take what we learned from Smith-Waterman and apply it to a Global Alignment Algorithm
